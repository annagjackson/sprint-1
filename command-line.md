the command line allows you to communicate with Git Hub via the terminal. I can, for example create and edit files and send changes to git hub,merge and track changes.

Terminal Commands:
1. git status: find out what's happening on github, see what changes have been made. Great when you're lost
2. git clone <repo url> : clones repo from git hub into workspace
3. cd ~/workspace: tells the terminal to open the folder workspace
4. git add <filename>: this stages files, identifying the files we want to put in the repository
5. git add -A : stages files that have been added or changed
6. git commit -m: adds a message explaining the commit. Should be written so that someone else can understand what you've done
7. git push: pushes changes from stage to GitHub
8. git checkout -b <branch name>: tells git hub to make a new branch and gives it a name
9. git checkout <branch-name> or git checkout master: moves between branch and master
10. atom . : opens Atom to edit files.
